# DeepLearningCourse Lab 2

The objectives of this lab is to further familiarize students with the basics of Keras and Deep Learning. In particular, we will learn how to manipulate images, create learning models and parameterize them, see the effects of different activation functions and regularization terms, as well as how to visulize learning progress.
This lab is slightly adapted from an online tutorial by Adrian Rosebrock.
