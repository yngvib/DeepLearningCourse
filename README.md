# DeepLearningCourse Lab 2

The objectives of this lab is to further familiarize students with the basics of Keras and Deep Learning. In particular, we will learn how to manipulate images, create learning models and parameterize them, see the effects of different activation functions and regularization terms, as well as how to visulize learning progress.
This lab is slightly adapted from an online tutorial by Adrian Rosebrock.

Read the code in each of the steps in the tutorial carefully with the aim of fully understand what is going on (the instructor will help as needed, and the run each step.

Once, you have finished going through all the steps, try to improve the test accuracy of the ANN, for example, by:
- using different activation function in the hidden layers
- increase number of layers (?)
- add regularizers (see Keras documentation)

Were you able to improve the test accuracy of the network? Show your result to the lab instructor.
